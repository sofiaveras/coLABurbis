<h3> About the project </h3>
<p> coLAB urbis is a undergraduate thesis for the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of the University of Brasilia - UnB. From an organic view of Urbanism, witch is, the city formed from the spontaneous logics of society, this project thesis aims to present a development strategy, a model of urban occupation, for an uninhabited area in the interior of Goiás, in the municipality of Goianira. The strategy is divided into two parts: the Collaborative Urban Design and the Collaborative City Management. </p>

<p> In its first phase the owners of the lots earn the lot by exercising some activity in it, be it a job, or housing, or even agriculture. In addition, the lots are self-sufficient, meaning that the lot owner needs to address the infrastructure issues (roads, waste disposal, sewage, drinking water and energy) within his lot. </p>
